# Task Managment Application (DDD)

I've been thinking about building some application for other beginner front-end developers I know, I hope this will be useful for them to use as a demo backend and a way for me to learn new archituctures as I'm planning to build other apps but using other ways.

Please give this project a start if you find it useful
